======= UNDERSTANDING MACHINE LEARNING =======
exo1:
-the model output represent the top movies with the highest proba of matching the selected taste
exo2:
-Machine learning methods can be considered AI methods -> TRUE
-AI and data science share the same goal, but AI uses methods from computer science and data science uses methods from statistics. -> FALSE
-Machine learning has become the most prominent subset of AI. -> TRUE
-Machine learning is used in data science to make predictions. ->TRUE

**qn from vid:
There are three types of machine learning. 
The first listed, reinforcement learning, is used for deciding sequential actions, like a robot deciding its path or its next move in a chess game. 
Reinforcement learning is not as common as the others and uses complex mathematics, like game theory. 
It won't be covered any further. The most common types are supervised and unsupervised learning. 
Their main difference lies in their training data

**Tasks ordered:
extract features
split the datasets -> (train, test)
train model using training dataset
evaluate the results with the testing dataset

*Supervised Learning
Learning from labeled data. The model is given inputs and the correct outputs, so it learns to predict the right answer.

*Unsupervised Learning
Learning from unlabeled data. The model tries to find patterns, groups, or structure on its own without being told the correct answers.

flavors of supervised learnig: classification and reggression (more down)
==> *Regression: (numbers)
Predicts a continuous value (numbers that can vary on a scale).
Example: predicting house price, temperature, or someone’s height.

    *Classification: (categories)
Predicts a category/class from a set of labels.
Example: spam vs not spam, cat vs dog, disease type, etc.

=======DEEP LEARNING=======:

Deep Learning def:
A branch of machine learning that uses multi-layered artificial neural networks to learn complex patterns from large amounts of data.
It’s especially powerful for things like image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and big-data tasks.

what happens indside a neural network in order !:
The car images are transformed to numbers
The pixel intensities are fed into a neural network
Neurons will learn to detect edges
Neurons will learn to detect more complex objects like wheels, doors, and windows
Neurons will learn to detect shapes of vehicles
The image is classified as a car or a truck

whats an nlp?
Natural Language Processing (its like ai trying to be human hmmmm)
A field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

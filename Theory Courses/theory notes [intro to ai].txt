=============theory course: undertsanding ai:
*video 1:
1950, first year of thought abouta  inteligent machine
Alan Turing (mathematician)

-some limits:
true AGI dont exist yet (artifical general inteligence) ex: ai surpass humans in everything, fully sentient robot per say
we only have ANi (artificial anrrow inteligence) ex: GPT, self driving cars


*video2:
machien learning helps in:
-prediction
-inferences
it also uses (pattern recognition) and exceed in (problem solving)
generative ai uses previous data to generate new ones like text, image, music etc..
another key ai element is (automation)

ai chatbots can struglle with:
-social nuance
-emotional inteligence
-empathy
-also difficulties handling new and unfamilliar situations

"AI IS ONLY GOOD AS THE DATA IT LEARNS FROM"

Which AI capability is most essential for a system that helps a delivery company find the fastest routes for their drivers?
!-> optimization


*video 3:

deep learning is more of an advanced machine learnign where the ai:
-uses neural networks to tackle big challenges
-recognize images
-play games

to help ai undersatnd problem and amke smart decision it needs to learn:
-knowledge representation
-reasoning

->NLP: enables ai to understand and generate human languages, texts and speeches



================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

==>Algorithms and AI systems demystified:


how ai collect data (data acquisition)
-NLP and audio: capturing speech, sounds.
-computer Vision: stellite images, fingerprints, etc.
-Robotics and sensors: temraptures, touch, motion, gravity, etc.
